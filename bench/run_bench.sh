# Use Docker to execute a command inside the running container.
# This command uses 'curl' to send a JavaScript command to the browser's debugger,
# which triggers the downloadMetrics() function.
# NOTE: This requires the browser to be started with the --remote-debugging-port=9222 flag.
# For this task, we'll simulate this by reminding the user to manually trigger it.
